The reported weight effects of concomitant non-anti-obesity medications should be Interpreted with caution, because the data describing these weight effects:
1. Are mostly derived from observations of studies not specifically designed to evaluate the effects of these medications on body weight
2. Are mostly derived from comparisons of the reported effects from different studies, rather than derived from a direct head-to-head comparison within the same controlled clinical trial
3. Studies often report variable weight effects, depending on the condition being treated (e.g., psychiatric medications being used for multiple psychiatric conditions), dataset, analysis [head-to-head versus meta-analysis, and specific agents having especially inconsistent reported effects (e.g., haloperidol, sertraline)]
4. The reported effect is mostly expressed as mean values, with the potential for wide variances in individual weight responses to a particular drug
